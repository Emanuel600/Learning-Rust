	It was probably not a good idea to start with a project this complicated on a language I'm not
  not familiar with. Regardless, this was a pretty fun project, I believe it would've been better if
  I had first made a cli calculator and moved on from there, slowly implementing features instead of
  starting with complex numbers and attempting to add a calculator on top.
  
	I am aware that Rust offers a default crate for complex numbers that is - as far as I can tell -
  complete, I did not use it because I figured I would learn more if I implemented everything by hand,
  and I do believe I was right on that.
